- I have done very little with HTML and Javascript before, though I do have some experience. I learned HTML for the first time in high school but have not touched it since. Also, in my last internship I worked with some Javascript but it was very limited and my focus was on the backend.
- I enjoy the easy, intuitive UI's of Chrome and Firefox. I also like to use the extensions that come with both.
