# lab-1 - What is Git?
Introduction to Git and exploration of browsers

In this lab you will do the following:
 - Create a GitHub Account
 - Learn to use the LXTerminal on your Virtual Machine
 - Use Git to clone a repository
 - Commit and push changes to that repository to submit your homework

## Create a GitHub Account
You should have received a link that will create a repository for this lab assignment to your account. Click on this link: if you already have a GitHub account you can sign in here, or if you don't have one you can create one now.


## Learn to use the LXTerminal on your Virtual Machine
For this first lab you will need to open your Virtual Machine and use the Terminal for the first time. You can reach the terminal by pressing on the Windows like button on the bottom left hand corner of the screen and go to System Tools -> LXTerminal.

You will see the infamous black screen with white letters. You are now officially a hacker :)

The black screen should display something like this:

```
student@student-VirtualBox:~$
```

That prompt is saying that your username is "student" and you are logged into the "student-VirtualBox" computer (the name of the virtual machine). You are now currently in the folder "~", which means your home folder which is:

```
/home/student/
```

Now we want to change directories to the Documents folder by doing the following:

```
cd Documents
```

And now we are in the location where we want to clone the repository we created by clicking on that invite link.
